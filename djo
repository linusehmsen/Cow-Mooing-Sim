    Animation added small fixes
    
    a short description would be that now the game part of the game is finished, a long one would be:
    
    I added animations back and i got it working after just one tutorial and now   when you click Mouse0 (primary (normally left) mouse button) the CircleCollider2D enables for 60 frames and I did some code (without tutorials) so now when the player presses Mouse0 (and the collider is enabled) the player will deal some damage to the enemies (only wolves so far) and i did some changes to the HealthPackagesSpawner scipt so that they spawn better now than before.
    
    so overall I'd say a good day for CMS.

    Removed animations + small fixes
    
    I removed the animations because i didn't understand them and because Ã­ feel like i have to understand unity, c# code and visual studio a bit more before i want to get into the animations.
    I also did some coding it doesn't work rn but i (hope i)  will fix that tomorrow.

    I added tags
    
    i added tags to the things that were "untagged" so that i can use more specific yet simpler code in the future if i want to fx. the fences if i want the Cow(player) to losses damage (fx. 'cause of electricity if i change the fences to electric fences on this level or another) every time they touche the fence the fences tags are Fences.
